# Northcoders News API

This is the back end for my NC news project hosted at https://nc-news-newsboard.netlify.app/

Before running this project locally, you will need to add two files, .env.test and .env.development in order to create the environment variables. 

In each of these files you will need to add PGDATABASE=correct_database_name. 

see db/setup.sql for the correct database names.
